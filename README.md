The Algorithm
Here’s our algorithm for this project:
1. Turn on LED 1.
2. Wait half a second.
3. Turn off LED 1.
4. Turn on LED 2.
5. Wait half a second.
6. Turn off LED 2.
7. Continue until LED 5 is turned on, at which point the process reverses
from LED 5 to 1.
8. Repeat indefinitely.
The Hardware
Here’s what you’ll need to create this project:
• Five LEDs
• Five 560 W resistors
• One breadboard
• Various connecting wires
• Arduino and USB cable
