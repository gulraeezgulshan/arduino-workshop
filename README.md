# Project #1: Creating a Blinking LED Wave

## The Algorithm
1. Turn on LED 1.
2. Wait half a second.
3. Turn off LED 1.
4. Turn on LED 2.
5. Wait half a second.
6. Turn off LED 2.
7. Continue until LED 5 is turned on, at which point the process reverses from LED 5 to 1.
8. Repeat indefinitely.

## The Hardware
- Five LEDs
- Five 560 W resistors
- One breadboard
- Various connecting wires
- Arduino and USB cable

# Project #4: Demonstrating a Digital Input

## The Algorithm
1. Test to see if the button has been pressed.
2. If the button has been pressed, then turn on the LED for half a second, and then turn it off.
3. If the button has not been pressed, then do nothing.
4. Repeat indefinitely.

## The Hardware
- One push button
- One LED
- One 560 W resistor
- One 10 kW resistor
- One 100 nF capacitor
- Various connecting wires
- One breadboard
- Arduino and USB cable
