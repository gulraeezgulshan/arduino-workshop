# Project #1: Creating a Blinking LED Wave

## The Algorithm

1. Turn on LED 1.
2. Wait half a second.
3. Turn off LED 1.
4. Turn on LED 2.
5. Wait half a second.
6. Turn off LED 2.
7. Continue until LED 5 is turned on, at which point the process reverses from LED 5 to 1.
8. Repeat indefinitely.

## The Hardware

- Five LEDs
- Five 560 W resistors
- One breadboard
- Various connecting wires
- Arduino and USB cable
