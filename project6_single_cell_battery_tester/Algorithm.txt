The Algorithm
-------------
1. Read from analog pin zero.
2. Multiply the reading by 0.0048 to create a voltage value.
3. If the voltage is greater than or equal to 1.6 V, then briefly turn on a green LED.
4. If the voltage is greater than 1.4 V and less than 1.6 V, then briefly turn on a yellow LED.
5. If the voltage is less than 1.4 V, then briefly turn on a red LED.
6. Repeat indefinitely.
