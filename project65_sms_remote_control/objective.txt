In this project you’ll control the digital output pins on your Arduino by
sending a text message from your cell phone. You should be able to use
your existing knowledge to add various devices to control. We’ll allow for
four separate digital outputs, but you can control more or less as required.
To turn on or off four digital outputs (pins 10 through 13 in this
example), you’d send a text message to your Arduino in the following format:
#axbxcxdx, replacing x with either a 0 for off or a 1 for on. For example,
to turn on all four outputs, you’d send #a1b1c1d1.
